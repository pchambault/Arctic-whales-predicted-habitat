# Arctic-whales-predicted-habitat

This repository contains code and data necessary to generate the analyses and figures associated with the manuscript entitled "Future seasonal changes in habitat for Arctic whales during predicted ocean warming" (2022, Science Advances). Manuscript authors: Philippine Chambault, Kit M. Kovacs, Christian Lydersen, Olga Shpak, Jonas Teilmann, Christoffer M. Albertsen, Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen.

The filtered tracking dataset can be found here and includes the satellite tag-associated data filtered for the three whale species (Belugas, Narwhals and Bowhead whales), both localities (West and East Greenland) and both seasons (summer: Aug-Sep and winter: Dec-Mar); Bel refers to Beluga, Nar to Narwhal and Bw to Bowhead whale.

The R codes have been archived in the Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/6618144). The R code supporting this manuscript is also available on GitHub (https://github.com/pchambault/Arctic-whalespredicted-habitat).

Both contemporary and climatic environmental data needed to run the habitat modelling scripts can be found on Copernicus-MyOcean (https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results) and CMIP6 (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/) portals.
